# Marmeto Sample API Project

## Overview
This project is a simple web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Marmeto API to display product cards for men's, women's, and kids' dresses.

## Features
- *Product Cards*: The application shows product cards with dress images, dress names, prices, and venue names, discount-price .
- *Category Filtering*: Users can filter the dresses based on categories. When a user clicks on a category button (Men, Women, Kids), only the dresses belonging to that category are displayed.

## How to Use
1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. You will see a list of product cards displaying various dresses.
3. To filter the dresses based on category, click on the respective category button. For example, to view only men's dresses, click on the 'Men' button.

## Future Enhancements
We plan to add more features to this application, such as sorting the dresses based on price and user ratings. Stay tuned for updates!
